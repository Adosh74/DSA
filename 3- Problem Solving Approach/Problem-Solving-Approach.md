# Problem Solving Approach Section

## Objectives

- Define what an algorithm is
- Devise a plan to solve algorithms
- Compare and contrast problem solving patterns including frequency counters,
    two pointer problems and divide and conquer

## Problem Solving Technique

1. [Understand the Problem](#1-understand-the-problem)

2. Explore Concrete Examples
3. Break It Down
4. Solve/Simplify
5. Look Back and Refactor

### 1. Understand the Problem

1. Can I restate the problem in my own words?

2. What are the inputs that go into the problem?

3. What are the outputs that should come from the solution to the problem?

4. Can the outputs be determined from the inputs? In other words, do I have enough information to solve the problem? (You may not be able to answer this question until you set about solving the problem. That's okay; it's still worth considering the question at this early stage.)

5. How should I label the important pieces of data that are a part of the problem?
